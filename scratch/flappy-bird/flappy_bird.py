#problems
#1. game moves forward in timesteps, need a timing mechanism.

#2. position of flappy-bird is determined by two things: user input and gravity
#--- for the purposes of the game, flappy-bird can be considered static horizontally.

#3. User input needs to be interpreted and used in-game
#4. A random series of pipes that follow various constraints need to move across the screen.
#5. Collision between flappy-bird and pipes or the floor or ceiling needs to be detected.
